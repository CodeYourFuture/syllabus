## 0) Flipped Classroom Practice (3h)

The video playlist contains some "content" videos and one "practice" video for each content video.

0. Define an object. Complete the following code, assigning objects to the variables `salem` and `ijeoma` so that the output of the program is as below. Don't change the function!

```js
let salem = {
  // fill in object here
};

// create an object here and assign it to a variable called ijeoma

// This function is provided. You should not modify it!
// It takes as input a person -> how it uses the fields
// in the person object will tell you what fields to put in the
// objects above
function logInformationAbout(person) {
  let age = 2023 - person.yearOfBirth;
  console.log(
    `${person.firstName} is from ${person.countryOfOrigin}`,
    `and will be ${age} years old in 2023`
  );
}

logInformationAbout(salem);
logInformationAbout(ijeoma);
```

The output should be

```
Salem is from Sudan and will be 30 years old in 2023
Ijeoma is from England and will be 22 years old in 2023
```

1. 1.1 Predict, evaluate and explain the following expressions in the node REPL

```js
let stock = {
  name: "aapl",
  lastClosingPrice: 171.45,
  lastFiveDaysClosingPrices: [180.33, 176.28, 175.64, 172.99, 171.45],
};

stock.name;
stock["name"];
stock.lastClosingPrice * 100;
stock.lastFiveDaysClosingPrices[1];

stock.name = "AAPL";

stock;
```

2. Add a field (a key + value pair) to the stock object, describing it's change over the last 5 days

```js
let stock = {
  name: "aapl",
  lastClosingPrice: 172.99,
  lastFiveDaysClosingPrices: [179.99, 180.33, 176.28, 175.64, 172.99],
};

// write code here to add the changeInLastFiveDays field to stock

console.log(
  "In the last 5 days, the stock changed by",
  stock.changeInLastFiveDays
);
```

The output should be

```
In the last 5 days, the stock changed by -7
```

3.1 Write a program that prints out to the console information from the following object

```js
uk = {
  name: "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
  shortName: "The UK",
  capitalCity: {
    name: "London",
    population: 9648000,
  },
};
```

The output should be

```
The capital of The UK is London. London has a population of 9648000
```

3.2 Complete the following program so that it prints out information about the stocks that went down in the past 5 days.

```js
const stocks = [
  {
    name: "aapl",
    lastClosingPrice: 172.99,
    lastFiveDaysClosingPrices: [179.99, 180.33, 176.28, 175.64, 172.99],
  },
  {
    name: "msft",
    lastClosingPrice: 327.29,
    lastFiveDaysClosingPrices: [340.69, 342.45, 334.69, 333.2, 327.29],
  },
  {
    name: "amzn",
    lastClosingPrice: 3408.34,
    lastFiveDaysClosingPrices: [3384.44, 3393.39, 3421.37, 3420.74, 3408.34],
  },
  {
    name: "googl",
    lastClosingPrice: 2869.45,
    lastFiveDaysClosingPrices: [2951.88, 2958.13, 2938.33, 2928.3, 2869.45],
  },
  {
    name: "tsla",
    lastClosingPrice: 938.53,
    lastFiveDaysClosingPrices: [1101.3, 1093.94, 1067.0, 1008.87, 938.53],
  },
];

function getMessage(stock) {
  // return a message containing the name and last closing price of the stock
}

function isStockPriceDecreasing(stock) {
  // return a boolean indicating whether the stock decreased in price over the last 5 days
}

const decreasingStocks = stocks.filter(isStockPriceDecreasing);
const messages = decreasingStocks.map(getMessage);
console.log("Stocks that decreased in price over the last 5 days:");
for (const message of messages) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

Most of the code is already written. You should only modify the functions `isStockPriceDecreasing` and `getMessage`

The output should be

```
Stocks that decreased in price over the last 5 days:
aapl last closing at 172.99
msft last closing at 327.29
googl last closing at 2869.45
tsla last closing at 938.53
```

4. Complete the `lastClosingPrice` method of the stock object so that it returns the last element of the `lastFiveDaysClosingPrices` array. This practice exercise is optional.

```js
let stock = {
  name: "aapl",
  lastClosingPrice: function () {
    return this.lastFiveDaysClosingPrices[4];
  },
  lastFiveDaysClosingPrices: [179.99, 180.33, 176.28, 175.64, 173.99],
};

console.log(stock.lastClosingPrice());
```

The output should be

```
173.99
```

5. Add a test to your solution to `1-weather-report.js` in `JavaScript-Core-1-Coursework-Week3`. This test should check that when 3 city names are passed as an argument to the `getTemperatureReport` function, the returned array should be of length 3.

The `assertion` portion of such a test would look like this:

```js
expect(getTemperatureReport(usersCities).length).toEqual(3);
```

## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework

Before starting this week, be sure to review the solutions for last weeks coursework
