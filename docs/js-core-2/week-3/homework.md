## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework

Before starting this week, be sure to review the solutions for last weeks coursework

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-2-Coursework-Week2-Solution

Make sure you work out what you don't understand and spend some time considering how the code works.

In each of the folders you'll find a `solutions.md` file that will explain more of the solution to you. You should read each of them.

**Note**: This is a private repository. Please speak to your Teacher, Buddy or Class Coordinator to get access. You should ask them to invite your whole class.

## 1) Classwork

Firstly, complete any exercises you did not complete during class. They are essential practice for the rest of the homework tasks.

If you get stuck, reach out to your classmates on Slack for help!

## 2) Watch these videos (1 hours)

There are some really amazing videos online that explain some of the harder topics that we learnt this week.

I'd like you to search online around these topics

- Asynchronous vs Synchronous
- What is a JavaScript callback?
- Client-Server Architecture

Here are some to get started:
_Synchronous and Asynchronous Transmission_

_The Client Server Model | Clients and Servers_
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BlpPU_muY

_How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes_

Be sure to share what you find in your class channel!

## 3) JavaScript Challenges (14 hours)

Here are a set of exercise that will help you to solidify your knowledge of JavaScript.

For this step, you have three challenges to complete.

- Alarm Clock
- Quote Generator
- Slideshow

Each of these challenges could take you some time to complete

You can find them all in this repository

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-2-Coursework-Week3

Before you start, **make sure you fork the repository** to your Github account.

## 4) Give feedback on your colleague's coursework (1 hour)

Use what you learned in this lesson to give feedback to other trainees who have submitted their coursework.

Helping to give feedback on other peoples coursework doesn't only help them, it also helps you by reading a variety of different code.

You must

    View the open Pull Requests here

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-2-Coursework-Week3/pulls

    Find two pull requests from people in your class that have no, or few, comments on them
    Leave comments on the two pull requests with improvements or suggestions
    Leave a comment saying that you have reviewed it and a nice comment about something you liked (always remember to be nice!)

Make sure you mark at least two other pull requests. It's important that you see a variety of different answers!

Remember, you should use the Code Style Guide to help you

## 5) (Optional) Add extra features to your Challenges (5 hours)

In the "Extra" folder of this repository you will find extra tasks for you to complete.
