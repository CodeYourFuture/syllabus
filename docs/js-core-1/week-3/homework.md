## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework (45 minutes)

You should do this every week. We will stop reminding you next week.

Once a week, someone with Github maintainer access in your city will release the solutions repo to last week's coursework to your class team.
Your class team is a child of Students and lives here: https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/teams/students/teams

Once you have access to the solutions repo, review your work compared to the example solutions. There is a marking guide that talks through common mistakes. Which ones have you made? How will this help you identify what you need to practice more, and where you feel strong?

Write down your target areas and take them to your buddy group. What does your mentor think? Do they agree with your assessment?

## 3) JavaScript Exercises (3 hours)

These exercises will help solidify your knowledge of JavaScript. Open the "Exercises" folder and complete all of the challenges.

Before you start, **make sure you fork the repository** to your Github account.

## 4) JavaScript Challenges (10 hours)

Next, in the same repository complete all of the exercises in the "Mandatory" folder.

## 5) Code review in your Buddy Group

Code review is a valuable skill for a developer, and is a good way to practice talking about code with confidence. Let's level up our code review now.

1. Review Google's [engineering guide on code review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/comments.html).
2. In your Buddy group, code review each of your colleague's nominated pull reqs.
3. Stretch: Try [suggesting line changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request#applying-suggested-changes), and accepting them yourself:

## 6) Codewars (1 hour)

https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/running-the-course/codewars

Every week you need to complete at least three kata. Spend at least 20 minutes, three times a week, on your kata workout.

Find the collection for JS-1 Week 3 on the CodeYourFuture account: https://www.codewars.com/users/CodeYourFuture/authored_collections

Have you found the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.codewars.com/training/troubleshooting/) yet? :D

## 7) Learn About the Terminal part 2 (4 hours)

Most developers spend a lot of time using something called the terminal. This week, you are going to follow a course to learn about the terminal - it has [its own homework page here](/git/terminal/homework) for you to work from.

You should have started this course last week. Complete it now.

## 8) (Stretch) Extra JavaScript Challenges

Have some extra time before our next class? Fill it with these harder challenges to help you stretch your abilities.

**Alert:** Some of these challenges might include concepts that we haven't taught you yet. You should expect to frequently encounter concepts you haven't been taught in class yet or at all. Learning how to tackle this is a crucial skill we are supporting you to develop. How will you handle this? Will you create a study group? Find a mentor? Ask for a session in class? It's your professional development, so take control of it.

## Giving constructive feedback (PD - 1 hr)

Imagine yourself in one of the following scenarios. How would you prepare to give constructive feedback in that situation?

- Write a short paragraph explaining what you would do
- or write a dialogue between you and the person you are giving feedback

Scenarios:

- Your colleague took your lunch from the office fridge
- Your colleague keeps interrupting you and others in meetings
- Your flat-mate left dirty cups in the sink for several days

## Working with your team (PD - 2 hr)

Every week you will be requesting feedback from two people to help you get more insight into how you are progressing.

This week, invite one person from the class you have worked with this week (someone you have not already asked for feedback) for a call, and invite your PD or Education Buddy. Ask for their feedback.

Write a 250 word essay reflecting on your strengths and development areas as a result of their feedback.
