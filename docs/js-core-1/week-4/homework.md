## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework (30 minutes)

You should do this every week from now on. We will stop reminding you soon.

Once a week, someone with Github maintainer access in your city will release the solutions repo to last week's coursework to your class team.
Your class team is a child of Students and lives here: https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/teams/students/teams

Once you have access to the solutions repo, review your work compared to the example solutions. Set a timer for thirty minutes. There is a marking guide that talks through common mistakes. Which ones have you made? How will this help you identify what you need to practice more, and where you feel strong?

Write down your target areas and take them to your buddy group. What does your mentor think? Do they agree with your assessment?
