## Flipped classroom recap/Q&A

The flipped classroom practice should have trainees

- Evaluate some boolean expression in the REPL
  - true/false literals
  - comparisons with `==`
  - comparisons with `===`
  - comparisons with `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
  - logical operations to combine boolean expressions: `&&`, `||`
- Write and run programs using `if` statements
  - without `else` clause
  - with `else` clause
- Write and run programs using `while` statements
- Some exposure, but maybe not practiced:
  - terminal commands (cd, pwd, )
  - `else if`

Some questions/prompts that may be useful

- What does this program do? (show programs of varying degrees of complexity using boolean expressions, conditionals and iteration to regulate summing and console.logging)
- What does this expression evaluate to, using boolean expressions?
- What kinds of data types have we seen so far? (without getting too technical, "string", "number", "boolean", maybe "undefined").
- What is the operator that allows us to figure out the type of some data.
- What is the difference between `9 > 8` and `9 > 8 === true`
- Why/when do we use conditionals
- Why/when do we use iteration
- Discuss solutions to practice exercises (particularly 3.2 as it asks how many test cases we should write)
