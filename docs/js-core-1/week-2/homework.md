## 1) Review Solutions for Last Week's Coursework (45 minutes)

You should do this every week. We will stop reminding you soon as you get used to it.

Once a week, someone with Maintainer access in your region will release the solutions to last week's coursework by giving repo access to your class team.

Your class team is a child of Students and lives here: https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/teams/students/teams

Once you have access to the solutions repo, review your work compared to the example solutions. There is a marking guide that talks through common mistakes. Which ones have you made? How will this help you identify what you need to practice more, and where you feel strong?

Write down your target areas and take them to your buddy group. What does your mentor think? Do they agree with your assessment?
