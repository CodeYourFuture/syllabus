## 0) Flipped Classroom Practice (3h)

The video playlist contains 5 "content" videos and 3 "practice" videos.

Here is an overview of the practice exercises:

1.1 Write a program that prints out to the console:

```
Hello Code Your Future
```

1.2 Write a program that prints out to the console:

```
Hello Maha
Hello Megumi
Hello Mohammad
```

2.0 Evaluate some expressions in the node REPL:

  - The sum of any two numbers
  - Your age this year (based on the difference between the current year and your year of birth)
  - A string containing your name
  - A variable called `name` with your name assigned to it
  - A template string using the name variable and a greeting in your language 

2.1 Write a program that prints out to the console

```
Hello Maha your place in the waiting list is 1
Hello Megumi your place in the waiting list is 2
Hello Mohammad your place in the waiting list is 3
```

Can you think how you could use variables to represent the greeting (`hello`) and the position in the waiting list (`1`, `2`, `3`)?

2.2 Maha has been taken off the waiting list. Modify your program so that it prints out to the console:

```
Congratulations Megumi your place in the waiting list is 1
Congratulations Mohammad your place in the waiting list is 2
```

Did using variables make it easy or hard to make this change?

3.0 Write a program that contains a function called `getAgeAtEndOf2023`. The function should take a year of birth as an argument and return a person's age in 2023. Call this function multiple times to print out to the console:

```
Greg will be 39
Mirabela will be 36
```

3.1 Modify the program you wrote in 2.1 so that it prints out the same result but uses a function called `getWaitingListMessage`

3.2 Modify the program you wrote in 3.1 so that it prints out to the console 

```
Hello Maha your place in the waiting list is 1
Hello Megumi your place in the waiting list is 2
Hello Mohammad your place in the waiting list is 3
Hello Margaret your place in the waiting list is 4
Hello Mohand your place in the waiting list is 5
Hello Mohib your place in the waiting list is 6
Hello Michael your place in the waiting list is 7
```

Did using a function make it easy or hard to make this change?
