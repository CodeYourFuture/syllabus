## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework (1h)

You should do this every week from now on. We will stop reminding you soon.

Once a week, someone with Github maintainer access in your city will release the solutions repo to last week's coursework to your class team.
Your class team is a child of Students and lives here: https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/teams/students/teams

Once you have access to the solutions repo, review your work compared to the example solutions. There is a marking guide that talks through common mistakes. Which ones have you made? How will this help you identify what you need to practice more, and where you feel strong?

Write down your target areas and take them to your buddy group. What does your mentor think? Do they agree with your assessment?

## 1) FreeCodeCamp (1 hour)

If you haven't already, you should complete all of these lessons on FreeCodeCamp. This is the same as the [Scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/basicjavascript) you did as prep, so you should already have completed these lessons. This coursework is to help you practice and remember those lessons.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

Make sure you have completed the following lessons from the Basic JavaScript course: All the lessons starting at _Comment Your JavaScript Code_ **up to and including** _Assignment with a Returned Value_
