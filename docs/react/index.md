## Overall Learning Objectives - React module

By the end of the three lessons & homework, trainees should be able to build a React application:

- Written with components
  - Appropriately composed/nested
  - Split across multiple files
- Uses props to pass values between components
  - Data like numbers/strings/objects/arrays
  - Functions as event handlers
- Uses state to react to user interaction
  - E.g. a button can be clicked to increment a counter
- That fetches data from an API
  - Loading, success and error states are shown
- Containing a form
  - Form inputs that can be filled out by the user
  - Can be submitted, triggering an update in the app

<!-- TODO: use this to make a rubric? -->

For advanced trainees, some further objectives would be:

- Use class components instead of function components/Hooks
- Explain why React state is used over plain old JavaScript variables

## Out of scope

These topics are considered out-of-scope:

- Object-Orientated JavaScript (classes/inheritance)
  - Details of `extends`/`super()` are not necessary to use React (they are an implementation detail of `Component` class), so don't go out of the way to teach this
- Redux
  - Want to focus on learning and practising the basics of React, before introducing new concepts
  - Learning Redux will be easier once confident with React
- CSS-in-JS
- In depth functional programming
