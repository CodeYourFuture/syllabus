## 6) Challenges (10 hours+)

The **best** way to get better at React is to practice by building small projects.

To help you with project ideas, we have provided several challenges. You can see a full list of the challenges [here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/). Some you can complete now, but some require knowledge of later weeks - look out for the "Prerequisites" section in the instructions.

We recommend that you attempt the following challenge:

- [High Score Table - Level 1](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/tree/master/challenge-high-score-tables)

Stretch Goals: Some other suitable projects for you to work on right now are:

- [Baby Names Picker - Level 1](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/tree/master/challenge-baby-name-picker)
- [Countries - Level 1](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/tree/master/challenge-countries)
- [Job Listing - Level 1](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/tree/master/challenge-job-listing)

You should complete these challenges in the order they are in above.

## 7) Codewars (1 hour)

Do your usual three kata and then...

1. Find the pinned suggestions thread in the #cyf-codewars Slack channel
2. Suggest a kata, or upvote one, to add to the syllabus

## 8) IronHack Labs Practice (Stretch)

If you want more practice with the basics of making React components and passing props,

You should completed exercises 1-7 of https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-react-training

Notes:

- **Do NOT make a pull request** although the repo readme says so. We don't want the staff at the other school getting your PRs!
- Skip or simplify "Iteration 3" if you have problems with the maths.
  - E.g. just pass a max number `<RandomNumber max={100} />` and multiply that by `Math.random()`. Or pass no props.
- In "Iteration 6" just pass the prop as normal: `<Rating rating={4.5} />`.
  - To do it as specified in the exercise would require you to use something new: "props.children".

## 9) Prepare for the next class (1 hour)

In our next class we'll be exploring the difference between Props vs State.

Spend some time reading about the difference between the two.

Here are some resources to get you started

1. Read Props vs State
