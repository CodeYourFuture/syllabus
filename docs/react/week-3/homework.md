## 3) Challenges (15 hours+) (Recommended)

The **best** way to get better at React is to practice by building small projects.

Continue to work on your projects from previous weeks. Complete as many of the projects as you can before the next lesson.

- [Baby Names Picker - All Levels](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/tree/master/challenge-baby-name-picker)

## 5) CodeWars (1 hour)
https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/running-the-course/codewars#codeyourfuture-collections

Every week you need to complete at least three kata. Spend at least 20 minutes, three times a week, on your kata workout. 

This week you must choose your own kata, based on what you know you need to practice.

**Upcoming milestone**: Check your levels. Before you are accepted on to a Final Project on the developer track, you need to complete the Final Projects collection and reach a **Level 5 kyu** in Codewars. Are you on track to reach this standard? Have you run a study group to work on kata? Have you reached out on the #cyf-codewars channel? What is your plan to meet this goal?

## 6)  Set your SMART goals (PD - 2 hr)

Check [this site](https://smartblogger.com/smart-goal-examples/) where you will find  goal setting scenarios you can practice with.

Think of 3 goals you want to achieve. They can contribute to your professional or personal development, they can aim to help you get healthier or even to find a job! Once you decide what the goals are going to be about, follow the guide below:

*Write Goals Down*

Take the time to write down your goals following the SMART framework and post them somewhere that you can see them. For team goals, place them somewhere everyone can see them. If it’s just for yourself, post a note next to your computer screen with the goals. Writing goals down brings them to life and makes them real. It’s also a good reminder of what you are working on.

*Share Goals With Relevant People*

Sharing goals sets the tone for accountability. Share goals with your team, your supervisor or a mentor. A shared goal is a goal that comes with a commitment to work hard to achieve the goal. Make sure that you share goals with a supportive person who will encourage you to press on when things get hard.

*Regularly Evaluate Progress*

Check in and see how you’re doing toward your goal. If the goal is a monthly goal, you may want to have daily or weekly check-ins to see what progress has been made. This helps you redirect energy and change course if something you are doing isn’t working and you aren’t making progress. It’s better to see this sooner than later while you can still adapt with enough time to succeed.

*Celebrate Wins*

When you succeed, celebrate. But don’t think that you need to wait until the entire goal is achieved before you give yourself a pat on the back. If you find yourself making excellent progress during a check-in, celebrate that too. The little successes help you maintain the energy to work toward the bigger goal.

To submit this coursework, share 3 goals on your coursework page and your plan to achieve them.
