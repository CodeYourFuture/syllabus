## Demo (60 minutes)

_Led by Trainees, presented back to the class_

Integrate all of your work together and share your progress so far with the mentors.

Your presentation should last **no more than five minutes** and could include:

- Slides detailing what you've done this week
- UI/UX designs of your project
- A video of your project
- A live example of your project

If you want to prepare a quick presentation you can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pQ7teLv6k4uDvpG8qVLs5YgzpD7jRbMUmyyszHsNPhc/edit#slide=id.g90bd724b34_0_0)

The most important aspect of this presentation is that you are **clear** and **concise**. We want to see that you can present yourselves well and communicate information effectively.

At the end of your presentation you will have to answers questions on your project from the rest of the class. This will last for **a maximum of five minutes**.

## Retrospective (30 minutes)

_Facilitated by TAs_

Retros can help a team focus on what is important and what they can improve for the next week. We like to use [Postfacto](https://pivotal.github.io/postfacto/) - if your team doesn't have a board setup already please contact Jon for help (`@jonrsharpe` on Slack or jonathan@codeyourfuture.io).

- 5 mins - Individually everybody notes down.
  - You should include:
    - All the things that went well
    - All the things that didn't go well
    - Anything you should
- 10 minutes - In your groups discuss the ideas raised and group them together
  - Don't talk about solutions yet!
  - Identify key problems
- 15 mins - talk about solutions and identify actions to tackle problems

## User research (30 minutes)

_Facilitated by Product Managers_

If you're building an internal product - show what you’ve built and what you’re planning to build next to potential users (other trainees, mentors, etc.) and use any feedback they have to improve your plans.

If you're working with on external product this might be tricky to do immediately but you spend time discussing how you could find users to demo to and the best way to contact them.

## Sprint planning (60 minutes)

_Facilitated by Product Managers_

Decide what you’re each going to be doing during the following week and where you want to be by the next class.

## Technical support (60 minutes)

_Facilitated by TAs_

Mentors will be on hand to help you get unstuck from any blocking technical issues.


## Cooling periods during final projects (30 min)

Cooling periods are for teams that are struggling to collaborate, communicate or work together in an agile way. This is an indication that the team may not be on track to graduate due to concerns about their professional skills. 

If a team needs a cooling period they will need to: 
1. Stop working and take a 5 minute break
1. Reflect on what's working well and what is not working and their preferred ways to communicate. 
1. Re-establish how they work together as a team.
1. Create a 5 step action plan about how they will resolve further challenges. 

The team must give feedback to the volunteers and discuss their strengths and weaknesses, reflections, how they will work together as a team and their action plan to resolve further challenges. 

Once they have communicated with their volunteer team, they will be allowed to proceed on their technical assignments. 

The cooling period should last no longer than 30 minutes.
