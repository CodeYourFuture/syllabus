See [Week 2](../week-2/lesson) for instructions for this week. 

Make sure to check in again on the contributions per team members, as detailed on [Week 3](../week-3/lesson)

Each team must fill out their [handover document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hWrWS1kyHfJnzSeTOc7mwjElSJx_xtk6Down1Bzlaos/edit) once they have finished the final project development. This document is important to ensure the Product Owner and technical team that would continue working on this product has all necessary information about what has been done.
