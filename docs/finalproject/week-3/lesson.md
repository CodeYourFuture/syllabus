See [Week 2](../week-2/lesson) for instructions for this week. You are working as a team to deliver a product, so will continue using that format through the Final Projects

## Overview

- Check In
- Cooling period


### Check In: how are the contributions of all team members so far?

It's important to evaluate our contributions to the group. Here's what we expect:

- Roughly equal pull requests (PRs). That is, we do not expect everyone to open the exact same number of PRs or commit the same number of lines of code, but we do expect features to be fairly evenly shared. As a quick guide: in a group of four, no one should be committing more than **33%** of the features and no one should be committing less than **20%**.
- Sometimes PRs are not merged, as the project develops and your understanding of the problem domain develops with it. That is absolutely fine and normal. It is still important that you show your work. 
- A full stack developer must deliver features that touch each part of the stack. This means at minimum you must build a component of UI that interacts with the database and you must configure and manage that entire interaction pathway. At best this means multiple features across different parts of the stack.

For graduation, we evaluate each role against the Skills for the Information Age skills descriptions, which you should check for more details.


### Cooling periods during final projects (30 min)

Cooling periods are for teams that are struggling to collaborate, communicate or work together in an agile way. This is an indication that the team may not be on track to graduate due to concerns about their professional skills. 

If a team needs a cooling period they will need to: 
1. Stop working and take a 5 minute break
1. Reflect on what's working well and what is not working and their preferred ways to communicate. 
1. Re-establish how they work together as a team.
1. Create a 5 step action plan about how they will resolve further challenges. 

The team must give feedback to the volunteers and discuss their strengths and weaknesses, reflections, how they will work together as a team and their action plan to resolve further challenges. 

Once they have communicated with their volunteer team, they will be allowed to proceed on their technical assignments. 

The cooling period should last no longer than 30 minutes.
