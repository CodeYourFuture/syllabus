#### Submitting your work

- Create a new branch for level 2
- Remember to commit and push your code often.
- Once you're ready to submit your work for review, do a final push and create a Pull Request.
  Note: If you've added your code to the same branch you were using last week, then it will just update your original Pull Request and you won't need a new PR.

### 5) Prepare for next class (.5 hours)

You need to prepare for every class.

The syllabus is a sample lesson, so you might do something different in class, but the broad learning objectives will be similar. Read the learning objectives. What other reading can you do to prepare for class? Is there any code to checkout from github?
