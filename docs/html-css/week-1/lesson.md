## HTML/CSS Project

In today's class, we will begin adapting styles on the [Bikes for Refugees](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/bikes-for-refugees) project.
We'll review some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your application process and learn some new concepts.
Fork the repository to your personal account and then clone the repository.

## Who uses the web?

:::note Exercise (10 minutes)
As a group, let's think of everyone that uses the web.

- What kinds of people use the web?
- How might their experiences be different?
:::

As web developers, we don't build websites for ourselvesâ€”we build them for our users.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to build websites that can be used by all users of the web.
These include:

- Users that are blind or have low vision
- Users that are colourblind
- Users with mobility impairment
- Users that are deaf or have hearing loss

To aid using the web, these users might use assistive technologies.
These include:

- Screen readers, which is software that reads out content on the screen to the user.
- Screen magnification software, which enlarges the content on the screen for the user to see better.
- Speech input software, which allows the user to perform commands using their voice instead of a mouse and keyboard.

Creating accessible websites is important for users with disabilities and users that use assistive technologies so they can access the same content as able-bodied users.
This is especially important when the website provides an essential service, such as one through a government website.
In this module, we will learn some of the ways to make websites accessible.

## What makes a web page?

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/webpage-parts.png').default}
alt="Diagram showing that structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behaviour (JavaScript) are interlinked"/>

A web page consists of three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
They define the structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behaviour (JavaScript) of the page.

> **Separation of Concerns:** In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns))

> **Principles:** During the course, we will highlight principles that apply to the specific topic but also to Computer Science and Programming in general. It is important to understand these principles, terms and apply them to your thinking in general.

:::note Exercise (5 minutes)
In the Bikes for Refugees project, spend a few minutes exploring the `.html` and `.css` files.
Why don't we put everything in one file?
:::

## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language used to create documents that are displayed on web browsers.
It gives **structure** and **meaning** to content by using tags such as `<h1>` and `<p>` to describe headings and paragraphs of text.

### HTML Anatomy

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/html-anatomy.png').default}
alt="HTML code of an element with a p tag, class=text attribute, and 'Welcome to lesson 1' content"/>

An HTML element is made up of **tags**, **attributes**, and **content**.

- A **tag** is the HTML element name enclosed in angle brackets
  - `<p>` is the **opening tag**
  - `</p>` is the **closing tag**
- An **attribute** comes after the HTML element name within the angle brackets
  - `class="text"` is the **attribute**
  - `class` is the **attribute name**
  - `text` is the **attribute value**
- The **content** is the part of the code in between the opening and closing tags
  - `Welcome to lesson 1` is the **content**

:::note Exercise (1 minute)
All together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example.

Which parts are the elements, tags, attributes, and content?

```html
<article>
  <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
  <p>Get to know the HTML basics.</p>
  <a href="http://html5rocks.com">Read Article</a>
</article>
```

:::

### HTML Structure

Every HTML document has the same base structure, shown in the code example below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My web page</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <article>
      <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
      <p>Get to know the HTML basics.</p>
      <a href="http://html5rocks.com">Read Article</a>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `html` element declares that it is an HTML document, and contains a `head` and `body` element.

- The `head` contains data about the web page, such as the name of the page (`My web page`) and the text encoding (`UTF-8`).
- The `body` contains the content which is shown in the browser.

HTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called **nesting** tags or creating an HTML **tree**. Between the opening `<article>` tag and the closing `</article>` tag there are three other tags. We call these **child** tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.

<img class="onDarkMode_whiteBg" src={require('!file-loader!../assets/html-hierarchy.png').default}
alt="Tree diagram showing an article tag with h1, p, and a tags as direct children"/>

:::note Exercise (5 minutes)
As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.

```html
<article>
  <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
  <p>
    <span class="author">Author:</span>
    <a href="http://codeyourfuture.io">Code Your Future</a>
  </p>
  <p>Get to know the HTML basics.</p>
  <a href="http://html5rocks.com">Read Article</a>
</article>
```

## Semantic HTML

> Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or **meaning**, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)

When writing HTML code, we can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, we help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired understand the content better.

When possible, we should use semantic HTML instead of generic HTML like `<div>` and `<span>`.
The following four sections cover different types of semantic HTML we can use.

If you want to view all semantic HTML elements, visit the [MDN HTML elements reference page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

:::tip
When creating a web page, we should always think about how to structure the content using semantic HTML **first**, then think about the styling afterwards.
:::

### Sectioning Content

We can put groups of content that make up areas of a web page inside 'sectioning' elements. These split the page up into named sections that help to organise the page's structure.

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/webpage-structure.png').default}
alt="Wireframe of a web page with <header> at the top, <main> at the middle, <footer> at the bottom, and <aside> at the right"/>

The image above shows a common layout of a web page.
We can use specific HTML elements for each of these sections.

- We can use a `<header>` element for the header content
- We can use a `<footer>` element for the footer content
- We can use a `<main>` element for the main content of the page
- Sidebar content can go inside an `<aside>` element
- If there is a list of links, for example within the `<header>` of a page, they can go inside a `<nav>` element

Additionally, we can use `<article>` and `<section>` to divide these sections into more sections.

:::tip
Use these sectioning HTML elements in every website you build.
This lets screen reader users jump to these [sections](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G115.html) of the website quickly.
:::

### Text Content

For text we mainly use these block and inline elements.

- `<h1>` to `<h6>` for **headings**
  - There should be only one `<h1>` element on the page, and we shouldn't skip levels
- `<p>` for **paragraphs** of text
- `<ul>` and `<ol>` for **lists**
  - `<ul>`, **u**nordered **l**ist for items not in any particular order
  - `<ol>`, **o**rdered **l**ist for lists where the order matters
- `<em>` for **emphasis**
- `<strong>` to indicate **importance**, seriousness or urgency

### Image Content

We can use `<img>` to display images on our page.

Every `<img>` element **must** have an `alt` attribute which describes the image.
This is important so that if the image does not load or if the user is using a screen reader, users can still understand the image content.

If the image is not important because it is only for decoration, we can provide an empty `alt` (`alt=""`) to indicate this.

```html
<!-- Image with a description -->
<img src="sleepy-cat.jpg" alt="A sleeping cat" />

<!-- Image for decoration -->
<img src="decorative-image.jpg" alt="" />
```

### Tabular Content

We can use `<table>` and its related tags to display tabular content.

Below is a table with a caption, along with the HTML code that creates it.

<table>
  <caption>Family member ages</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Kehinde</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chadwick</td>
      <td>27</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```html
<table>
  <caption>
    Family member ages
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Kehinde</td>
      <td>29</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chadwick</td>
      <td>27</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

:::note Exercise 1 (10 minutes)
_Paired Programming Challenge_

Work in pairs to determine where the following tags should be used instead in the Bike for Refugees `index.html` file.

- `<header>`
- `<footer>`
- `<main>`
- `<nav>`
- `<article>`
- `<aside>`

Who benefits when we write **semantic** HTML?
:::

:::note Exercise 2 (10 minutes)
_Paired Programming Exercise_

Work in pairs to determine what changes we should make to the code below to make it more semantic. Semantic means 'meaningful'.

```html
<div>Pancake recipe</div>
<div src="pancakes-with-syrup.jpg" />
<div>A quick and easy recipe to make pancakes!</div>
<div>Ingredients</div>
<div>
  <div>175g flour</div>
  <div>3 eggs</div>
  <div>450ml milk</div>
  <div>Sunflower oil</div>
</div>
<div>Method</div>
<div>
  <div>Add the flour, eggs, and milk to a bowl</div>
  <div>Whisk the mixture and set it aside for half an hour</div>
  <div>Heat a pan and add some sunflower oil</div>
  <div>Add some of the mix to the pan and cook for a few minutes</div>
  <div>Flip and cook the other side until done, then serve</div>
</div>
```

:::

:::note Exercise 3 (10 minutes)
_Solo exercise_

Create a table that contains your favourite food and where it comes from.
It should have two columns: the first column should contain the name of the dish, and the second column should contain the country of origin.
You can create the table on https://codepen.io/pen/ if you wish.

## What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to modify the **style** of the HTML document.

### CSS Anatomy

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/css-anatomy.png').default}
alt="CSS rule with an h1 selector, font-size:1.5rem; declaration, font-size property, and 1.5rem value"/>

A CSS rule is made up of **selectors**, **properties**, and **values**.

- A **selector** describes which HTML elements to style
  - `h1` is the **selector**
- A **property** is the specific style to apply
  - `font-size` is the **property**
- A **value** is the value for the property
  - `1.5rem` is the **value**
- A **declaration** is the combination of the property and value
  - `font-size: 1.5rem;` is the **declaration**
- A **rule** is the combination of the selector and its declarations
  - `h1 { font-size: 1.5rem; }` is the **rule**

:::note Exercise (1 minute)
All together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example.

Which parts are the rules, selectors, properties, values, and declarations?

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
p {
  color: #333;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
}

.box {
  border: 1px solid #333;
}
```

:::

### Common CSS properties

A typical web page contains text structured into headings and paragraphs.
We can use CSS to modify the styling of text.
Some common CSS properties are shown in the following example:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, serif;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: normal;
  line-height: 1.5;
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
}
```

:::note Exercise (10 minutes)
_Paired Programming Exercise_

In the Bikes for Refugees project, work in pairs to make the `Donate Now` and `Donate a bike today`
buttons on the page an orange-red `#c05326` colour, and make the `Volunteer` button white `#fff`
with orange-red `#c05326` text. Leave the border for now.
:::

### CSS Units

When we measure objects in real life we might use centimeters or inches.
CSS also uses measurement units like these.

There are two types of units: absolute and relative units.

- Absolute units are always the same size, even when the user zooms in on the browser.
- Relative units are based on the size of something else, such as the font size or viewport size.
  When the user zooms in the browser, elements using relative units will increase in size too.

The following table contains some of the most commonly used CSS units.

<table>
  <caption>Common CSS units</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Unit</th>
      <th>Relative or absolute</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>rem</code></td>
      <td>Relative</td>
      <td>1rem is equal to the font size of the root element. If the root font size is 16px, then 1rem = 16px and 0.5rem = 8px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>em</code></td>
      <td>Relative</td>
      <td>1em is equal to the font size of the parent element. If the parent font size is 16px, then 1em = 16px and 0.5em = 8px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>%</code></td>
      <td>Relative</td>
      <td>100% is equal to the full width or height of the parent element</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>px</code></td>
      <td>Absolute</td>
      <td>1px is 1/96th of 1 inch</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The following code example shows how these units are typically used.

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}

.sidebar {
  padding: 1rem;
  width: 25%;
}
```

If you want to view all CSS units, visit the [MDN CSS values and units page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units#numeric_data_types).

:::note Exercise (5 minutes)
All together, let's review what each of the values in the previous code example mean.
:::

### CSS Selectors

We target or _select_ HTML elements with CSS Selectors. The selector comes before the ruleset.

<Tabs defaultValue="exercise"
values={[{ label: "Exercise", value: "exercise" }, { label:"Clues", value: "clues" }]}>
<TabItem value="exercise" label="exercise" default>

:::note Exercise (5 minutes)
Go around the room and name a selector each until you run out.
:::
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="clues" label="clues">

<table>
<caption>Common CSS selectors</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Selector</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Class selector</td>
<td><code>.text &#123; &#125;</code></td>
<td>Selects all HTML elements with class <code>class="text"</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Type selector</td>
<td><code>p &#123; &#125;</code></td>
<td>Selects all <code>p</code> HTML elements</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ID selector</td>
<td><code>#text &#123; &#125;</code></td>
<td>Selects all HTML elements with ID <code>id="text"</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Descendant combinator</td>
<td><code>article p { }</code></td>
<td>Selects all <code>p</code> HTML elements that are a descendant of an <code>article</code> element</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child combinator</td>
<td><code>article > p { }</code></td>
<td>Selects all <code>p</code> HTML elements that are a direct child of an <code>article</code> element</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pseudo-class selector</td>
<td><code>p:hover &#123; &#125;</code></td>
<td>Selects all <code>p</code> HTML elements that have a mouse hovering on them</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To view all CSS selectors, visit the [MDN CSS selectors page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors#reference_table_of_selectors).

:::tip
There are many selectors, but professionals typically avoid using type, ID, and combinators, as well as the `style` attribute.
:::

:::note Exercise (10 minutes)
_Paired Programming Exercise_

In the Bikes for Refugees project, work in pairs and use pseudo classes to make the background color of all buttons change to the darker colour `#934423` when in a "hover" and "focus" state.
Test that it works by hovering over all buttons with your mouse, and by using the `Tab` key to focus on each button.
:::

### CSS Box Model

In CSS, everything is a **box**. An image is a box. A link is a box. The following diagram shows what the box model looks like.

![Box Model. Source: MDN](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13647/box-model-standard-small.png)

The **content** is the text or image and it has a **border**.
Inside the border there is space called **padding**, and outside the border there is space called **margin**.

We can modify these properties using CSS like in the following example.

```css
.content {
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: black;

  margin-top: 1rem;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  margin-left: 1rem;

  padding-top: 0.5rem;
  padding-right: 1rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.5rem;
  padding-left: 1rem;
}
```

Instead of typing out each property, we can use shorthand properties for border, margin, and padding so we can make the code more concise.

```css
.content {
  /* width | style | color */
  border: 1px solid black;

  /* Apply to all four sides */
  margin: 1rem;
  padding: 1rem;

  /* vertical | horizontal */
  margin: 0.5rem 1rem;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;

  /* top | right | bottom | left */
  margin: 1rem 0.5rem 2rem 0.25rem;
  padding: 1rem 0.5rem 2rem 0.25rem;
}
```

We can also modify the **width** and **height** of the content like in the following example.

```css
.square {
  height: 10rem;
  width: 10rem;
}
```

:::note Exercise 1 (20 minutes)
In the Bikes for Refugees project, work in pairs and:

1. Use the `padding` property to add some more horizontal space inside the navigation links in the header.
1. Use the `padding` property to add more space inside all buttons.
1. Use the `border` property to remove the border from all buttons.
1. For bonus points, you can use the `border-radius` property to make the corners of the buttons rounded.

:::

#### Block and Inline Boxes

We can think of CSS as having two types of boxes: **block** boxes and **inline** boxes.

- Block boxes take up the whole width of its container and stack on top of each other vertically.
- Inline boxes are only as wide as its content and flow next to each other horizontally. In other words they go along in a line.

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/css-block-inline-flow.png').default}
alt="Diagram showing that block elements stack vertically and inline elements stack horizontally."/>

Block and inline boxes have a few more differences, which if you're not aware of can make it difficult to understand why inline elements are not being styled as expected.
The following table describes the differences between the two in more detail.

<table>
  <caption>Block versus inline boxes</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Block</th>
      <th>Inline</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Does it start on a new line?</td>
      <td>Yes, block elements start on a new line</td>
      <td>No, inline elements continue on the same line</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Does it take up the full width?</td>
      <td>Yes, block elements extend to take up the full width</td>
      <td>No, inline elements are only as wide as its content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How does <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> work?</td>
      <td>They work as expected for block elements</td>
      <td>They do not work for inline elements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How does <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, and <code>border</code> work?</td>
      <td>They work as expected for block elements, and push other boxes away</td>
      <td>
        Horizontal <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, and <code>border</code> work as expected, and push other boxes away.
        Vertical <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, and <code>border</code> work as expected but do not push other boxes away.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

HTML elements are either block or inline elements.

| Common block elements   | Common inline elements |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `h1` to `h6`            | `a`                    |
| `p`                     | `img`                  |
| `ul`, `ol` and `li`     | `button`               | 
| `form`                  | `input` and `select`   |
| `table`                 | `label`                |
| `article` and `section` | `strong`               |
| `div`                   | `span`                 |

To change the type of box, we can use the `display` CSS property like in the following example.

```css
/* Change the inline `img` element into a block */
img {
  display: block;
}

/* Change the block `li` element into an inline */
li {
  display: inline;
}
```

If you want to view a list of all block and inline elements, visit the
[MDN block-level elements page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements#elements) and
[MDN inline-level elements page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements#elements).

## CSS Inheritance, Cascade and Specificity

In CSS, you can write many rules including ones that conflict with one another.
How does CSS know when to apply rules and when to override them?
It uses the concepts of **inheritance**, **cascade**, and **specificity** to figure it out.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is where a CSS property is inherited by child elements.
Some properties that are inherited are `font`, `color`, and `line-height`.
This means we can set the color of text for the `body` as `pink` and all its descendent elements will have pink text.

```css
/* All descendent elements of `body` will have pink text because of inheritance */
body {
  color: pink;
}
```

### Cascade

In CSS, the stylesheets cascade which means that the order of the CSS rules matter.
If we have two CSS rules that target the same element, then the one that comes last in the stylesheet is used.

```css
p {
  color: red;
}

/* Since this rule comes last, the `p` element will be blue and not red because of cascade */
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Specificity

Specificity is how CSS figures out which rule to use when different selectors are used for the same element. Selectors have different 'weights'.
A rule with an ID selector is typically chosen over one with a class selector, which is typically chosen over one with a type selector.

```css
/* An ID selector has the highest specificity of these three rules, so the paragraph is orange */
#paragraph {
  color: orange;
}

/* Even though this rule comes after, the paragraph is not yellow because the ID selector has higher specificity */
.paragraph {
  color: yellow;
}

/* Even though this rule comes after, the paragraph is not green because the ID selector has higher specificity */
p {
  color: green;
}
```

To read more about inheritance, cascade and specificity, visit the [MDN Cascade and inheritance page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).

## Flexbox

Flexbox is a name for a set of CSS layout rules for laying out items in rows or columns. They allow you to apply rules to elements to place them side-by-side and re-arrange them. You just specify how you want your elements arranged and the browser will scale this arrangement depending on the screen size and device used for viewing.

To add flexbox:

1. Identify the elements you want to arrange in a certain way. For example, these three buttons:
   ```html
   <button>Home</button>
   <button>Gallery</button>
   <button>Contact</button>
   ```
1. Make sure they're part of the same container:
   ```html
   <div class="menu">
     <button>Home</button>
     <button>Gallery</button>
     <button>Contact</button>
   </div>
   ```
1. Tell the container to use Flexbox to arrange all its children:
   ```css
   .menu {
     display: flex;
   }
   ```

Once you have flexbox applied to the container you can start adding more rules to tell it exactly how the elements should be arranged.

### Display elements in a row

Use `flex-direction: row` to display the child elements in a row.

```css
.menu {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/css-flex-direction-row.png').default} alt=""/>

### Display elements in a column

Use `flex-direction: column` to display the child elements in a column.

```css
.menu {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/css-flex-direction-column.png').default} alt=""/>

### Space out elements equally in a row

Use `justify-content: space-between` to space out elements equally.

This can be used when the elements are displayed in a row:

```css
.menu {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between; /* or space-around */
}
```

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/css-flex-justify-content-row.png').default} alt=""/>

### Space out elements equally in a column

This can be used when the elements are displayed in a column:

```css
.menu {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between; /* or space-around */
}
```

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/css-flex-justify-content-column.png').default} alt=""/>

In the above 2 examples we used the same rule `justify-content: space-between`, but we changed `flex-direction` from `row` to `column`.
Notice how `justify-content` works in the same direction as `flex-direction`.
In the images above, the green arrow for `justify-content` is operating in the same direction as `flex-direction`.

### Align elements in a row

Use `align-items: center` to align the child elements in the centre.

This can be used when the elements are displayed in a row:

```css
.menu {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
}
```

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/css-flex-align-items-row.png').default} alt=""/>

### Align elements in a column

This can be used when the elements are displayed in a column:

```css
.menu {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/css-flex-align-items-column.png').default} alt=""/>

While `justify-content` works in the same direction as `flex-direction`, align-items works the opposite way!
Have a close look at the above imagesâ€”the green arrow is opposite to the yellow `flex-direction` one.

:::note Exercise (20 minutes)
Continue editing the "Bike for refugees" website by adding 3 boxes below Jumbotron, and using Flexbox, make sure they are arranged like in the sketch below:

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/flexbox_practice.png').default}/>

You can start with something like the below, by just adding a container, and the 3 text pieces within it. Try to use flexbox to position the text elements within the container to match the picture:

```html
<div>
  <!-- CONTAINER START -->
  <div>Check availability</div>
  <div>Donate bikes</div>
  <div>Volunteer with us</div>
</div>
<!-- CONTAINER END -->
```

Once that's done you can move on to creating boxes for each individual text piece, and again, using flexbox to position the text piece in the middle of its box.
:::

:::note Exercise (5 minutes)
Let's take a break from flexbox for a minute. Do you remember the `:first-child` pseudo class? There's a `:last-child` pseudo class as well.

See if you can use these pseudo classes to give the left box a grey background (`#ddd`) and the right box a grey border (`1px solid #ddd`).
