## Mandatory coursework

### 1) ðŸ”‘ Cakes and Co (10 hours)

Follow the instructions in this repo to create your own Cakes company website.

- Fork then clone https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/HTML-CSS-Coursework-Week3
- Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file.

### 2) Module Project: Code review (3 hours)

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/HTML-CSS-Module-Project

Learning to read and review other people's code is a key skill for a developer. When you join a new team, you will usually also join an existing codebase, and you will need to be able to read it. If you've never looked at code written by other people, you will find this really challenging (it's already hard!).

1. Do the [Github Lab course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests) in reviewing pull requests
2. Ask for a code review from a colleague on your Karma project.
3. Complete a code review for a colleague on their Karma project.

You don't need to have completed the entire project to get code review. You can ask for help with something specific.

### 3) Module Project: Responsive (3 hours)

Work through Level 3 and make your Karma clone responsive.

### 4) Prepare for next class (0.5 hours)

You need to prepare for every class.

The syllabus is a sample lesson, so you might do something different in class, but the broad learning objectives will be similar. Read the learning objectives. What other reading can you do to prepare for class? Is there any code to checkout from github?
