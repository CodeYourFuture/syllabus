## Coursework Source of Truth...

Is your Google Classroom, not here! Teachers and trainees, make sure you check your Google Classroom for latest updates.

## Mandatory coursework

### 1) ðŸ”‘ Cakes and Co (10 hours)

Follow the instructions in this repo to create your own Cakes company website.

- Fork then clone https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/HTML-CSS-Coursework-Week3
- Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file.

### 2) Module Project: Code review (3 hours)

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/HTML-CSS-Module-Project

Learning to read and review other people's code is a key skill for a developer. When you join a new team, you will usually also join an existing codebase, and you will need to be able to read it. If you've never looked at code written by other people, you will find this really challenging (it's already hard!).

1. Do the [Github Lab course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests) in reviewing pull requests
2. Ask for a code review from a colleague on your Karma project.
3. Complete a code review for a colleague on their Karma project.

You don't need to have completed the entire project to get code review. You can ask for help with something specific.

### 3) Module Project: Responsive (3 hours)

Work through Level 3 and make your Karma clone responsive.

### 4) Prepare for next class (0.5 hours)

You need to prepare for every class.

The syllabus is a sample lesson, so you might do something different in class, but the broad learning objectives will be similar. Read the learning objectives. What other reading can you do to prepare for class? Is there any code to checkout from github?

### 5) Developing a growth mindset as a developer (PD - 1 hr)

Task 1: Reflection

Write your reflections on on why it is important to have a growth mindset as a developer and how a growth mindset will positively impact you in your career in the long term.

Task 2: Introspection

Learn more about neuroplasticity (Watch, Hear, See). How can you change your brain? Is neuroplasticity, the biological foundation for growth mindset?

1. Watch this Sentis Brain Animation Series video - https://youtu.be/ELpfYCZa87g 

2. Based on the information in the video reflect on these questions:

- When did I have a closed mindset this week, and why?
- When did I have an open mindset this week, and why? 
- What have I learnt about myself, as a result? 
- What will I do differently next time? 

Task 3: Interaction

Reflect on what your barriers are when it comes to participating in live coding, hold yourself accountable and write in the Slack channel about what actions you will take in order to overcome your barriers to participating in live coding and write a supportive message to your peers who have shared their barriers in the channel.
