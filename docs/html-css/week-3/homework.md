## 1) Why Responsive? (5 hours)

You should complete the whole course.

Don't worry if you don't have a phone you can use for Remote Debugging. You can use the browser's Device Emulation instead.

## 3) Prepare for the next class (2 hours)

Next lesson, we will be going back to learning about JavaScript.

Review what you've learnt so far to prepare yourself for the next lesson.

We recommend that you

- Complete some online courses to see what gaps you have in your knowledge you have
- Prepare any questions you have about basic JavaScript
- Have a call with other students to discuss anything you don't understand.
