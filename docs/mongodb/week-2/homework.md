## 3) Making Your Chat App Full Stack (3 hours)

You now know enough about MongoDB to make the Node apps that you made in the last module store the data they have in a database.

For this homework - you should add MongoDB to your Chat Server homework so that all of the data is stored in a database.

You can find the project here:
https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/node-challenge-chat-server

You should continue with the same project that you made before.
