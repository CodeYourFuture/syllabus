Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer. We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing. Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest. I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness. The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful. We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area.

The room is well&clean but the staff not helpful. Indeed, because of a flight schedule change, I asked the Airbnb host and the welcome desk of the hotel how I could manage my last night cancellation to be refund. I did exactly what they asked me to do and have been informed two days after that they refused my request of refunding... Despite the policy rules, I found it very dishonest and not correct at all as I have asked them before doing the cancellation on Airbnb and the flight confirmation.\nMoreover, I felt insulted when they made me left the welcome desk to go to the basement in order to let other clients of the hotel believe everything is perfect (I was calm and just trying to solve the issue).\nSo to conclude, the room ok but bad experience in this Airbnb that is an hotel!"},{"_id":"236131644","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1518930000000"}},"listing_id":"10057826","reviewer_id":"11623469","reviewer_name":"Adam","comments":"we rented the suite at the henry norman hotel, and it was lovely"}]}
