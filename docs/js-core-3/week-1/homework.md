## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework

Before starting this week, be sure to review the solutions for last weeks coursework

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-2-Coursework-Week3-Solution

Make sure you work out what you don't understand and spend some time considering how the code works.

In each of the folders you'll find a `solutions.md` file that will explain more of the solution to you. You should read each of them.

**Note**: This is a private repository. Please speak to your Teacher, Buddy or Class Coordinator to get access. You should ask them to invite your whole class.

## 1) Install ESLint (20 minutes)

ESLint is what is called an static analysis tool. It checks your code for common mistakes that can impact code quality and styling.

If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2) Thinking like a Programmer (2 hours)

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

- You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
- You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)

The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

- How to THINK like a programmer
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNazO2tMHno
- Lessons in problem solving
  - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/
- Computational thinking
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbnTZCj0ugI

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?
2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?
3. What should you do if you get stuck?

## 3) JavaScript Exercises (4 hours)

Here are a set of exercise that will help you to solidify your knowledge of JavaScript.

For this step, open the "Mandatory" folder and complete all of the challenges.

Before you start, **make sure you fork the repository** to your Github account.

## 4) TV Show Project - Part 1/3 (12 hours) ðŸ”‘

In this weeks project we will be using the knowledge we learnt from JS1 & JS2 to build the first version of our website

### Project Details

All of the details for this project can be found here:

https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/js-core-3/index

You should complete up to and including Level 300

### Project Setup

It is very important that you make sure you project is setup correctly.

You should follow all of the setup steps here:

https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/js-core-3/tv-show-dom-project/getting-started

## 5) Give feedback on your colleague's coursework (1 hour)

Use what you learned in this lesson to give feedback to other trainees who have submitted their coursework.

Helping to give feedback on other peoples coursework doesn't only help them, it also helps you by reading a variety of different code.

You must

1. View the open Pull Requests here

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-3-Coursework-Week1/pulls

2. Find two pull requests from people in your class that have no, or few, comments on them
3. Leave comments on the two pull requests with improvements or suggestions
4. Leave a comment saying that you have reviewed it and a nice comment about something you liked (always remember to be nice!)

Make sure you mark at least two other pull requests. It's important that you see a variety of different answers!

Remember, you should use the Code Style Guide to help you

https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/code-style-guide

## 6) CodeWars (1 hour)

https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/running-the-course/codewars#codeyourfuture-collections

Every week you need to complete at least three kata. Spend at least 20 minutes, three times a week, on your kata workout.

Find the Collection for JS-3 Week 1 on the CodeYourFuture account: https://www.codewars.com/users/CodeYourFuture/authored_collections

#### 6a) Start mentoring others in the #cyf-codewars channel.

Remember to follow the channel rules. We don't give solutions in Codewars.

## 7) Plan the TV Show Project (PD - 1 hr)

Come together with your buddy group and draft an initial project plan for the TV Show Project referring to the user stories produced during the class.
