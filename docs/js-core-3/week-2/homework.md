## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework

Before starting this week, be sure to review the solutions for last weeks coursework

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-3-Coursework-Week1-Solution

Make sure you work out what you don't understand and spend some time considering how the code works.

In each of the folders you'll find a `solutions.md` file that will explain more of the solution to you. You should read each of them.

**Note**: This is a private repository. Please speak to your Teacher, Buddy or Class Coordinator to get access. You should ask them to invite your whole class.

## 1) Practice the concepts (2 hours)

This week's concepts can be challenging, therefore let's get an easy introduction using some interactive exercises! Check the following resources out and start practicing.

You can ignore anything to do with `XMLHttpRequest`

## 2) Code along (1 hour)

Now that you've learned about APIs and how to connect with them, let's apply it in the context of a complete application.

In the following application you'll be watching somebody make an API call to an external, public API.

You are welcome to code along as you watch - this will help you to understand what exactly the presenter is doing.

Enjoy!

## 6) Give feedback on your colleague's coursework (1 hour)

Use what you learned in this lesson to give feedback to other trainees who have submitted their coursework.

Helping to give feedback on other peoples coursework doesn't only help them, it also helps you by reading a variety of different code.

1. View the open Pull Requests here

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-3-Coursework-Week2/pulls

2. Find two pull requests from people in your class that have no, or few, comments on them
3. Leave comments on the two pull requests with improvements or suggestions
4. Leave a comment saying that you have reviewed it and a nice comment about something you liked (always remember to be nice!)

Make sure you mark at least two other pull requests. It's important that you see a variety of different answers!

Remember, you should use the Code Style Guide to help you

## 7) CodeWars (1 hour)

https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/running-the-course/codewars#codeyourfuture-collections

Every week you need to complete at least three kata. Spend at least 20 minutes, three times a week, on your kata workout.

Find the Collection for JS-3 Week 2 on the CodeYourFuture account: https://www.codewars.com/users/CodeYourFuture/authored_collections

**Upcoming milestone:** Check your levels. Before you are accepted on to a Final Project on the developer track, you need to complete the Final Projects collection and reach a Level 5 kyu in Codewars. Are you on track to reach this standard? Have you run a study group to work on kata? Have you reached out on the #cyf-codewars channel? What is your plan to meet this goal?

## 8) Talk about your time management  (PD - 30 min)

Book a 121 session with your PD buddy about how you are managing your time; what is working and not working; what your time-management barriers are in your personal and professional life.
