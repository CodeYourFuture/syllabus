1. Name your new repo **exactly** this: `tv-show-dom-project`

1. Configure your site for automatic deployment to Netlify [Instructions here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/blob/master/others/deployment/1-for-html-module/cheatsheet-1.md)
1. Ensure the netlify site name is exactly `cyf-USERNAME-tv`.netlify.app where USERNAME is YOUR github username.
