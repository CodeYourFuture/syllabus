## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework

Before starting this week, be sure to review the solutions for last weeks coursework

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-3-Coursework-Week3-Solution

Make sure you work out what you don't understand and spend some time considering how the code works.

In each of the folders you'll find a `solutions.md` file that will explain more of the solution to you. You should read each of them.

**Note**: This is a private repository. Please speak to your Teacher, Buddy or Class Coordinator to get access. You should ask them to invite your whole class.

## 1) Changing fixed mindset (PD - 1 hr)

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU).

Think about a fixed mindset you currently have. Try and pick one relating to programming or your career. Make a new post in your cohort’s Slack channel where you briefly describe your situation and ask for help on changing your mindset. 

Additionally, you should also make a comment on one of your peers’ posts to help them.
