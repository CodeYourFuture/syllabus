## 1) Debugging Practice (3 hours)

We've hosted some Servers on Glitch but they're not quite working properly. Could you fix them for us?

- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice1
- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice2
- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice3
- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice4

### Start by remixing our example server

- [ ] Make sure you're logged in to https://glitch.com/
- [ ] Remix each example
- [ ] Name your new server `yourname` + NAME_OF_EXERCISE
- [ ] Check that it is working by making a request to `/`
- [ ] Fix the code on your version of the server

## 2) Chat Server API Project (12 Hours+)

Take a look at this repository:

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/node-challenge-chat-server

In that repository you will find a task to create a Chat Server.

To complete the homework you should:

1. Fork the repository
2. Complete the tasks
3. Create a pull request back to the original repository

## 3) Prepare a Presentation (1 Hour)

Prepare a VERY simple recap of what we did and what we learned in today's class in Node Week 1.

The presentation should last between 60 and 120 seconds

Time yourselves - that is NOT much time!

Next class we will be presenting to each other to share what we have learnt.

NOTE: Slides (or presenting from computer) is NOT allowed.

## 4) (Optional) Challenges

You can find additional challenges to work on [here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-node-challenges) if you finish all of your homework.
