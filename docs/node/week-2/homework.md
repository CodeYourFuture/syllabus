## 1) Debugging Practice (3 hours)

We've hosted some Servers on Glitch but they're not quite working properly. Could you fix them for us?

- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice1
- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice2
- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice3
- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice4

### Start by remixing our example server

- [ ] Make sure you're logged in to https://glitch.com/
- [ ] Remix each example
- [ ] Name your new server `yourname` + NAME_OF_EXERCISE
- [ ] Check that it is working by making a request to `/`
- [ ] Fix the code on your version of the server

## 2) Chat Server API Project (12 Hours+) ðŸ”‘

Take a look at this repository:

[Chat Server](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Node-Coursework-Week2)

In that repository you will find a task to create a Chat Server.

To complete the coursework you should:

1. Fork the repository
2. Complete the tasks
3. Create a pull request back to the original repository

## 3) Prepare a Presentation (1 Hour)

Prepare a VERY simple recap of what we did and what we learned in today's class in Node Week 1.

The presentation should last between 60 and 120 seconds

Time yourselves - that is NOT much time!

Next class we will be presenting to each other to share what we have learnt.

NOTE: Slides (or presenting from computer) is NOT allowed.

## 4) CodeWars (1 hour)
https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/course-processes/running-the-course/codewars#codeyourfuture-collections

Every week you need to complete at least three kata. Spend at least 20 minutes, three times a week, on your kata workout.

Find the collection on the CodeYourFuture account: https://www.codewars.com/users/CodeYourFuture/authored_collections

## 5) Challenges (Stretch)

## 6) Reflect about your own biases (PD - 1 hr)

Think of when you are stressed, feeling tired, rushed, as these situations tend to activate our biases. How may these feelings influence your behavior when working with a group? Reflect in a 250 word essay.

## 7) Challenge yourself (PD - 15 min)

Take an Implicit Association Test (IAT) [here](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) to identify what your unconscious biases are. There are multiple topics to choose from: Age, Gender, Sexuality, Skin-tone, Ethnicity, etc.
Remember: Awareness is the first step to combatting bias.
