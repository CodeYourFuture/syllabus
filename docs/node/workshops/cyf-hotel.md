## Introduction

**Brief**: Designing a hotel website

**Client**: CYF Hotels Ltd

**Date**: 28 January 2018

**Facilitators**: CYF Mentors

Now that you are almost a full-stack developer, we would like you to make us a website for our imaginary hotel.

Since you have a limited time, there is already an empty boilerplate project for you to take and build on top of.

In keeping with times, we are using the [Lean model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_services) and only developing features that we see necessary for the _Minimum Viable Product (MVP)_.

## Problem Statement

Currently hotel website is a little empty. Although some raw data is available from recording things on a computer, **Hotel Manager** and **Receptionists** do not have ways to view them in a useful way.

Similarly the hotel **Customers** cannnot get a link to their invoices online to view or pint them, so they are also unhappy.

## User Journeys

![Personas](../assets/persona.png)

We are looking at three personas today:

- Hotel Customer
- Hotel Receptionist
- Hotel Manager

`As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.`

- As a _Hotel Manager_, I want to **view a list of all customers**
- As a _Hotel Manager_, I want to **view a customers details by their customer account ID**
- As a _Hotel Manager_, I want to **view a list of all invoice**
- As a _Hotel Manager_, I want to **view a an invoice by its Invoice ID**

- As a _Hotel Receptionist_, I want to **list of all reservations**
- AS a _Hotel Receptionist_, I want to **view a reservation by its reservation ID**

- As a _Hotel Customer_, I want to **view my invoice page**

## Team Work

We need you to work in a team by dividing up the work

| Role               | Responsibility                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Backend            | API, data                       |
| Frontend           | HTML/CSS/Templates (Handlebars) |
| PM/User Experience | User journeys, tickets          |

As a trainee you can have multiple roles.

Get a mentor to help provide direction/focus for your team.

The PM creates tickets on Trello and assigns them between the team members
