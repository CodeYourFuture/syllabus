## Before you teach this lesson

If you are teaching this class in the coming weeks you **must** instruct your trainees to complete the instructions below.

[Node Preparation](../preparation)

If you trainees do not arrive with these steps completed then you will lose a lot of time on your first lesson. You should consider running short mid-week sessions the week before to help trainees get set up.

## Notes

### London (24/06/2020)

- Glitch and Codesandbox had issues
  - Possible non starters.
  - Didn't have reload button (code sandbox).
  - Groups tended to just rely on the one trainee whose setup was working. or work locally.
- Last exercise needs rework
  - Don't just return the data sent by user
  - "Why would you do this?"
- Breakout room exercises could have been more difficult
