## Before you teach this lesson

If you are teaching this class in the coming weeks you **must** instruct your trainees to complete the instructions below.

[Node Preparation](../preparation)

If you trainees do not arrive with these steps completed then you will lose a lot of time on your first lesson. You should consider running short mid-week sessions the week before to help trainees get set up.

- Breakout room exercises could have been more difficult
