Updated contribution guide is to be written

<!--
Before starting, please read the following general guidelines and
[checklist for a lesson](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/issues/9).
Participate in the discussion if you'd like.

There are [discussions](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/issues)
about each module and every class in a module.
Make sure to go through them or add a new issue/discussion point.

To contribute to the Code Your Future syllabus, fork and open a pull request to
[this repository](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus).
Contributions are accepted strictly through approved pull requests, even for
administrators of the repo.

Since this repository is the blueprint of our syllabus, we allow different
cohorts to adapt to their classes' needs and also update their syllabus
versions to reflect how the class goes.
We should always make sure **master** is relevant and up to date for future
classes with the feedback from the on-going teaching in each CYF chapter.

## A lesson template

Please use the [lesson template](lesson-template.md) as a starting
point for your new lessons.

Each lesson should follow that format: starting with
**what we will learn today** then **class contents**, **homework**
and **preparation for next class**.

The class contents and homework should follow the
[checklist for a lesson](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/issues/9).

Some of the most important guidelines are:

- Focus on exercises in the class rather than presentations or long explanations
- Prefer pointers to good documentation over explaining everything in the lesson
  itself
- The homework should be relevant, get harder gradually with an (optional)
  stretch goal for more advanced students.

## Add new modules or lessons

The repo is stuctured as `module-name\week-number`.
Add your content in the correct file.

If you've added a new file, add it as new entry in SUMMARY.md
to show it in the sidebar.
If the module contains many individual markdown files, add them as nested
bullets.
