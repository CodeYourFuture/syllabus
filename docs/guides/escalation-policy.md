When you get stuck during the homework you should follow the following:

1. First, search for answers on Google and Stack Overflow.
   If you have an error message, copy and paste it into Google.
2. When you are stuck for longer than 20 minutes - no longer! -
   write a question to your fellow students in your class channel on slack.
   Take a while to think carefully about the question.
   This is an important skill.
   Here is a great [guide to writing good questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
3. If you cannot get an answer from your fellow students,
   post your question in your class public channel,
   `@` the mentor for the class that covered the topic
   and we will reply as soon as we can.
