To make it easier for teachers and volunteers to find and review your homework,

All CYF coursework projects should be hosted with the following naming scheme:

`cyf-USERNAME-PROJECT_NAME`

...where:

- `USERNAME` is your GitHub username
- `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of the coursework project. If you are not sure, then ask!

Examples for the project called `cakes`

- `cyf-nbogie-cakes`.netlify.com
- `cyf-40thieves-cakes`.netlify.com
- `cyf-kkarimi-cakes`.netlify.com

Examples for the project called `photo-gallery`

- `cyf-lucymac-photo-gallery`.netlify.com
- `cyf-textbook-photo-gallery`.netlify.com
