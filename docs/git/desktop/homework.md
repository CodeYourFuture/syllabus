## 2) Upload your Website to Github (2 Hours)

To apply for this course you had to complete a website using what you've learnt so far. Let's save it to Github so we can look at it in a few months and see how much you've learnt!

### 1. Export from CodePen

Find your website that you made on CodePen and follow the instructions here

https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/exporting-pens/

When you've completed this step you should have a `zip` file downloaded somewhere on your computer.

### 2. Unzip File

When you've downloaded the `.zip` file you should unzip it to see all your files.

Make sure you put the folder in a place that you can remember.

Not sure how to do this? You can find instructions here:

https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File

### 3) Fork and Clone our Repository

Make a fork of the repository to your Github Profile and clone it to your computer.

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/My-CodePen-Website

You'll be using this forked version to host your website.

### 4) Add your files

Copy your the files that you've unzipped to the repository folder for your website.

You can find this folder by clicking `Show in Explorer` in Github Desktop.

### 5) Upload to Github

Next, you should use Github and Github Desktop to upload your website to your Github Profile.

If you get stuck, make sure to check this weeks lesson to see what we covered.

### 6) Done!
