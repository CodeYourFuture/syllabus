**Exercise objective:** To join a competition as a team

- Form a team of four
- Each member of the team chooses an object to describe to the rest of the team. Donâ€™t tell your team what your item is; they have to guess.
- Prepare as a team for 2 minutes to decide how to work as a team.
- Each member of the team will have 2 minutes to describe their item to the rest of the team.

The team(s) that guesses most items wins!

Tips:

- Choose items that are easy to find and likely to be nearby (pen, phone, book, notepad, mug, glasses, keyboard, etc.) 
- Keep an eye on the time
