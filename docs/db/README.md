# Teaching DB and SQL Module
## Introduction for Module Leaders
This module has two variants (db_a and db_b). The first, db_a, is the course that has evolved over years in the standard CYF syllabus. The second, db_b, is the course developed in the Manchester team (by Keith Bremer) which takes a different approach that tries to be more accessible to beginners. You should adopt one or the other (they're not entirely compatible) and work with it.

You should read through some of the materials and choose the one that best suits your approach. Note that the second (db_b) provides presentation slides that correspond to the course notes in both LibreOffice (.odp) and Powerpoint (.pptx) formats.
