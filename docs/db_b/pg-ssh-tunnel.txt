To enable ssh tunelling from client to postgresql, use the following commands as directed:

First, check that you can connect to the ubuntu_pg virtual machine using ssh (on Windows you can
use the PuTTY program to do this).

On the client machine (when using the ubuntu_pg VM this will be your host computer, e.g. Windows)

   ssh -L 63333:localhost:5432 cyf@ubuntu_pg
   
You should be prompted for user cyf's password on ubuntu_pg and the command should then connect you
to the VM as user cyf.  You must keep this connection open for the duration of your interactions
with the database.  Once you have connected (in a different terminal session) to psql this session
stays open even if you try to exit, until the psql session ends.

In a new terminal session use the command:

   psql -h localhost -p 63333 cyf_hotel cyf
   
to connect to your database on ubuntu_pg.  You will be asked for the database user's password
(the user is cyf in the above command) and then connected to the database.  From here you can
proceed normally.
