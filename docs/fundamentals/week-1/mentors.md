## Requirements gathering exercises

tl;dr: Things to make sure you emphasise:
1. Formalising requirements is useful, even if you already have vague requirements.
2. Bringing in your existing wider context is useful. Some requirements will always be missing.
3. Edge-cases!

There are short-term ("how they address problems now") and long-term ("how they work on projects and in groups") goals from this session.

Short-term:
1. Thinking about the problems they're trying to solve, rather than just jumping straight into solving them.
2. Thinking about edge-cases and bearing them in mind.

Long-term:
1. Starting on an MVP.
2. Prioritising features.
3. Considering trade-offs.

Really, the idea is to just get people to start exercising these muscles. It doesn't matter much what they do or produce, as long as they're thinking.

## Problem break-down exercise

We consistently see trainees try to jump straight into solving whole problems without breaking them down into smaller steps. This frequently leads to frustration and confusion. Accordingly, it's really important they start practicing breaking problems down now.

With the shopping exercise, ask people what the smallest steps they got to were, and what the biggest step they couldn't break down was. Try to break things down further.

For example:
* "Go to the shop" can be broken down into getting directions, choosing a direction, moving (until some condition?), and so on.
* "Find the first item on the list" can be broken down to walking up and down each aisle, comparing items with those on the list. Or looking up and matching categories from per-aisle headings.

Feel free to reduce to the absurd - the goal is to show that you can keep decomposing and decomposing.
