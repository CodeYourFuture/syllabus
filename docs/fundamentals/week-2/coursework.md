## Using an IDE

We will use an IDE to write our code during Fundamentals, just like professional programmers. We use VSCode, and you should already have installed it during your course preparation. Here's a reminder of the tutorial you were given:

**&rarr; [Visual Studio Code](https://www.codecademy.com/article/visual-studio-code)**

### Refresh your understanding of paths

Read this lesson on file paths and folders: [Using paths & folders](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/paths-folders/) and save the [cheatsheet](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/naming-paths-cheat-sheet/) to help you.

## CYF Blocks (8h)

Complete the [CYF Blocks](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io) Syllabus, including at least 6 "projects". Write down any questions you have to ask when we next meet.

Share at least two of your completed projects in google classrooms. Share your favourite project (or something completely new) in the Slack channel for your cohort.

## Organise a study session (PD - 2 hr)

Working together is the best way for you to learn. Teaching someone else helps to strengthen your knowledge. And getting help from your fellow students saves you time and keeps you from becoming a passive learner.

You will be randomly assigned a group using [random list team generator](https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator)

In small groups of 3, organise a study session to work on one piece of coursework. As a group you must decide on:
- The topic of the call
- The time of call (give people a few hours to get ready. Remember Slack is asynchronous communication!)
- Who will create the link to Google Meet where you will have the call.
- Who will open (start) the call in Google Meet.

Once you have decided the above:
- Make an announcement in Slack with your topic, time and link to call (anyone in can join even if they are not in your group. Just keep to just one topic and max 5 -6 people in a call)
- Ask people to react with an emoji if they want to attend
- If there are too many people - what should you do? Decide on a plan of action
