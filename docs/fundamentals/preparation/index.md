# Before the course begins

You can do so much to improve your chances of success with Code Your Future and you can start right now. Before the course begins, work through these resources to get yourself prepared, powerful, and ready to work. You can do this.

### Prep 1 : Grasshopper

You may have done Fundamentals 1 on Grasshopper, but what other courses can you unlock? The _Using a Code Editor_ course could be handy for Prep 2.

**[Work through Grasshopper](https://learn.grasshopper.app/)** for about fifteen minutes, three times a week. This will make it easier to grasp the fundamentals.

### Prep 2 : Developer Tools

Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and practice using a real developer environment. You don't need to write any code in your new IDE. Just find out where the buttons are and what some of them do. This [tutorial from Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/visual-studio-code) will help you.

:::note Exercise
Stretch goal: can you write and save a [markdown document ](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)in VSCode?

### Prep 3 : Developer Thinking

People in tech work with logic, so how do people improve their logical reasoning? Happily, with games! Practice your developer thinking by playing our brain games.


### Prep 4: HTML/CSS crash course

During Fundamentals, we will be building a website with a block-based programming tool called CYF Blocks. The underlying code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Prepare yourself now with this free crash course, to refresh and consolidate your learning from Intro to Digital.
