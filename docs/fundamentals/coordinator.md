## Preparation

To participate in Fundamentals, trainees must have completed [Intro To Digital](https://codeyourfuture.io/itc/). There are no exceptions.

## Cohort size

A Fundamentals cohort has a maximum size of 40 people. If you have more than 40 candidates, you need to split into more cohorts. For example: if you have 43 candidates, split the group into two cohorts of 22 and 21 respectively.

Launch the second cohort a minimum of 4 weeks later.

## Setting up

Trainees must complete the preparation outlined in the [Prep](./preparation/index.md) and come to class prepared. People will probably have some questions and hit some roadbumps, so it can be useful to be present in a class ITD Slack channel to unblock people, but don't do it for them.

## Schedule

The Coordinator owns the schedule of the Fundamentals Course and leads a mid week planning call before each session.

1. Each mentor notes page has an example schedule for the week, which you can adapt to suit your cohort.
2. You should also schedule at least one short break in the afternoon for prayers, breastfeeding, and other obligations.
3. Parcel out the sessions between volunteers in the planning call. At CYF we teach in teams and no one person dominates the day.
4. Once you've planned, make sure you share the schedule with all trainees and volunteers _at least 24 hours beforehand_, so they can make any necessary travel, childcare, religious, and other logistical arrangements.

## Coursework

A mentor needs to run the Google Classroom and make sure coursework is posted according to the schedule. This can be the Coordinator or another volunteer. Each week of the course has a coursework page and suggested coursework is listed there.

There is a Boilerplate Classroom you should clone in our shared Google Workspace with a draft version of each piece of work. Clone the boilerplate and then  schedule your coursework with publish and due dates.

You can set all the coursework up before the coursework starts, but do check you have the latest versions.

## Graduation

Graduation will happen the week after, as trainees have work to complete after the last session in order to graduate. You will track this work on the Fundamentals Tracker. There is a template in our Drive.

Everyone who meets the graduation criteria may be invited to the Software Development Course. You are not obliged to invite everyone.
